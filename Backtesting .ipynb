the one with the highest observed Sharpe ratio, $\\hat{SR}$. Even if each strategy has a true Sharpe ratio of zero, chance alone may yield a high $\\hat{SR}$ among many trials. The Deflated Sharpe Ratio (DSR) corrects for this *selection bias* by subtracting a “threshold” value, $\\hat{SR}_0$, which represents the expected maximum Sharpe ratio due solely to chance when $N$ independent trials are performed. In addition, the DSR adjusts for non-Normality in returns by incorporating sample skewness and kurtosis into the variance of $\\hat{SR}$.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2.

This probability reflects the likelihood that the true Sharpe ratio is greater than the threshold after deflating for multiple testing and non-Normality.\n","\n","In summary, the DSR formula combines adjustments for both selection bias (through $\\hat{SR}_0$) and non-Normal return characteristics (via skewness and kurtosis) to yield a statistically robust performance measure."],"metadata":{"id":"5IZO8QStzGTG"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["straregy_sharp_ratio = []\n","strategy_returns = []\n","for i in range(10):\n","  sharp_ratio_scores = []\n","  returns_scores = []\n","  for fold, (train_idx, test_idx) in enumerate(folds, 1):\n","      # Extract training and test data for this fold.\n","      X_train, y_train = X.iloc[train_idx , : ], y[train_idx]\n","      X_test, y_test = X.iloc[test_idx, : ], y[test_idx]\n","\n","      # Fit the model using XGBRegressor.\n","      model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100 * (i+1), class_weight='balanced' , random_state=42)\n","      model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n","      returns = compute_pl_for_stratgy(apple_new, X_test, model , threshold=0.55 )\n","      returns_scores.append(returns.values)\n","      sr = np.mean(returns)/np.std(returns) * np.sqrt(252)\n","      sharp_ratio_scores.append(sr)\n","\n","\n","  all_returns = np.concatenate(returns_scores)\n","\n","  print( np.mean(all_returns)/np.std(all_returns) * np.sqrt(252) )\n","  straregy_sharp_ratio.append(sharp_ratio_scores)\n","  strategy_returns.append(all_returns)\n","\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"MR_qCbEEuXHn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741961728072,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":630892,"user":{"displayName":"Ahmad Aghapour","userId":"10024107043211715538"}},"outputId":"3e318f16-ddef-4a59-e3f7-30ee0415641b"},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["1.6318413842590889\n","1.7479497751127233\n","1.8234767885974716\n","1.7571652261974533\n","1.7139614064809026\n","1.7221481834017407\n","1.7045003316491902\n","1.6810214248300943\n","1.6900359175088013\n","1.665825811474751\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# This code is from RiskLabAI\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","from scipy import stats as ss\n","\n","\n","def probabilistic_sharpe_ratio(\n","        observed_sharpe_ratio: float,\n","        benchmark_sharpe_ratio: float,\n","        number_of_returns: int,\n","        skewness_of_returns: float = 0,\n","        kurtosis_of_returns: float = 3,\n","        return_test_statistic: bool = False,\n",") -> float:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Calculates the Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio (PSR) based on observed and benchmark Sharpe ratios.\n","\n","    The PSR provides a means to test whether a track record would have achieved an observed\n","    level of outperformance due to skill or luck.
